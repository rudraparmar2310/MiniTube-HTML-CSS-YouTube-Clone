# MiniTube-HTML-CSS-YouTube-Clone
A static YouTube-style front-end built with only HTML and CSS. Recreates the look-and-feel of a video platform — responsive video cards, channel sidebar, top navigation, search bar, and video detail layout — without JavaScript or backend. Great as a portfolio piece to demonstrate layout, responsive design, using css and html
